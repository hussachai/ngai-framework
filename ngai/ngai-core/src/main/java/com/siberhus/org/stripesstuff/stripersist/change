I prepend com.siberhus to the package name of stripesstuff because
I would like to avoid class loading conflict when the users has already
had stripersist.jar in their classpath.


Changes in Stripersist
=============================================

 - Don't start transaction automatically 
   1 transaction per 1 request is quite limit and 
   cause a lower performance in read only statement
   
 - Remove static initializer block that show the build information
 
 - Remove StripersistInit.Classes, Use NgaiInit.Packages instead.
 
 - Add throws Exception in init(Configuration config) method.
